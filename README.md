# Welcome to my Raspberry Pi Project Repository!
This is a repo for my Raspberry Pi projects including internship projects. All the source code are either taken from the open source PN532 module example code or written by me.
I am learning embedded systems and I hope to create exciting projects absed on the Raspberry Pi microcontroller.
I am going to utilize this repo to organize my code, pictures/links to resources of my projects on Notion page. 

RFID project is for an ID scanner with an accompanying database. It has to be ran with a PN532 HAT module with Rapsberry Pi 4B. This project implemented the idea of finite state machine, where each function corresponds to a state that belong to all other available states to enter for each state. The purpose is to avoid confusion from use of integer to track different states that the system can enter. 
Others are small practice projects I made to learn to build each specific portion of the RFID scanner project.

Enjoy!
